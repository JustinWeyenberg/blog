I have a lifelong passion for programming, which started as a kid playing video games on the NES, then learning from books on C++ in middle school, and now over 15 years as a professional bringing client visions and user experiences to life.

My core skills include full-stack development in JavaScript and .NET in both team environments as well as solo projects. I have significant experience creating front-ends in React and back-ends with Node.js, C#, Entity Framework, and SQL Databases hosted on cloud platforms.
